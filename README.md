# what happened to old code?
It was too buggy and Nell said **skiddy** :rofl:, so I made a less buggy massban cause why not.
# C code?
Yea it's for Windows users or overall cython enjoyers, command to compile:
```
gcc -shared -pthread -fPIC -fwrapv -O2 -Wall -fno-strict-aliasing -I$PREFIX/include/python3.10 -o windows windows.c
