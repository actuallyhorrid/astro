# Astro
a faster copy of nells shitty comet nuker

also nell uses external libraries like its fucking cocaine

man never learned to use ansi color codes

(ily nell)

(One more note idrfc if you clown me for "skidding" comet, comet is very underrated and it's good but the requests are slow so I decided to do the job for Nell also Nell just simply fork it change logo and do whatever the fuck you want with it idrfc it's yours from the start I just pushed my updates and changed logo fucking faggot I also love you Nell)
# Why did you skid it?
cause nell hurts me deep inside that he uses external libraries

he also hurts me by fucking NOT ADDING A FULL FUCKING NUKER

so yea kys nell (jp ily)
