The closest nuker to lithium (ily Russian heavy and verlox!!!)

Nell isn't the real owner of comet nuker as he said :skull:

Nell: i literally have never heard of astro but this kid wants to say i was a developer for it to feel special

Nice Nell your not the owner of comet nuker, while it was just me saying you own comet nuker :skull:

Nell: crazy how people skid a python file just to feel valid
