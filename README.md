A Nuker based on Comet Nuker, except the original owner is a very bad maintainer, and he uses outdated libraries.

(One more note idrc if you clown me for "skidding" comet, comet is very underrated and it's good but the requests are slow so I decided to do the job for Nell also Nell just simply fork it change logo and do whatever you want with it idrc it's yours from the start I just pushed my updates and changed logo faggot I also love you Nell)
